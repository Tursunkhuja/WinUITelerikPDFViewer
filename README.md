# WinUI Telerik PDFViewer
This is WinUI single project to show PDF file using Telerik RadPDFViewer.

There is Print button to print the sample PDF file porgrammatically. But, currently it doesn't work because it is not fixed yet by Telerik. It should be fixed by Telerik.WinUI.Controls.PdfViewer version 2.3.0.
